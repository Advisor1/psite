					<p class="moveUp bold turquoise-col pHead-newColr"><b>Mutual Funds</b></p>
					<p class="bold pHead-newColr moveUp in-view" style="text-align:justify;">To many people, Mutual Funds can seem complicated or intimidating. We are going to try and simplify it for you at its very basic level. Essentially, the money pooled in by a large number of people (or investors) is what makes up a Mutual Fund. This fund is managed by a professional fund manager.</p>

					<p class="bold pHead-newColr moveUp in-view" style="text-align:justify;">It is a trust that collects money from a number of investors who share a common investment objective. Then, it invests the money in equities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other securities. Each investor owns units, which represent a portion of the holdings of the fund. The income/gains generated from this collective investment is distributed proportionately amongst the investors after deducting certain expenses, by calculating a scheme’s “Net Asset Value or NAV.</p>

					<p class="moveUp bold turquoise-col pHead-newColr"><b>Systematic Investment Plan</b></p>
					<p class="bold pHead-newColr moveUp in-view" style="text-align:justify;">Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is an investment plan wherein one can invest a fixed amount in a Mutual Fund scheme at regular intervals– say once a month or once a quarter, instead of making a lump-sum investment. The installment amount could be as little as INR 500 a month and is similar to a recurring deposit. It’s convenient as you can give your bank standing instructions to debit the amount every month.</p>

					<p class="bold pHead-newColr moveUp in-view" style="text-align:justify;">SIP has been gaining popularity among Indian MF investors, as it helps in investing in a disciplined manner without worrying about market volatility and timing the market. Systematic Investment Plans offered by Mutual Funds are easily the best way to enter the world of investments.</p>
