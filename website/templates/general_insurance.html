					<p class="moveUp bold turquoise-col pHead-newColr"><b>Health insurance</b></p>
					<p class="moveUp bold pHead-newColr in-view">
					Health insurance is a general insurance cover that provides protection against various surgical and medical expenses incurred by the insured person. In fact, in recent years, health insurance has been customized to fit the needs of patients with specific illnesses (e.g. cancer patients, people with diabetes, etc.).
					<br/><br>
					Some of the benefits that come with this general insurance cover include cashless treatment, pre and post hospitalization benefits, etc.

				    <p class="moveUp bold turquoise-col pHead-newColr"><b>Motor insurance</b></p>
					<p class="moveUp bold pHead-newColr in-view">
					For car owners, this general insurance cover is the most crucial one. Since accidents can happen at any point of time, motor insurance can make sure that you are covered for all the damages that your vehicle might cause or incur.
					<br/><br>
					Motor insurance is widely categorized into two types - for the car and for two-wheelers. Also, getting your vehicle insured is mandatory under the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988.
				    </p>

				    <p class="moveUp bold turquoise-col pHead-newColr"><b>Home insurance</b></p>
					<p class="moveUp bold pHead-newColr in-view">
					Your home is surely among your most valuable possessions, which is why you must ensure that it is secured with a home insurance policy. This general insurance cover provides protection for your home and its contents from various natural and man-made perils that might befall it.
					<br/><br>
					Natural disasters like fire, lightning, earthquake, floods, storm, and hurricanes are unpredictable risks that can cause extensive damage to your house. The same can be said for man-made calamities like strikes, riots, etc. A home insurance policy ensures protection for your home in the event of such disasters.
				    </p>
					
					<p class="moveUp bold turquoise-col pHead-newColr"><b>Travel insurance</b></p>
					<p class="moveUp bold pHead-newColr in-view">
					Traveling is an inevitable part of life, and so are the risks associated with it. That is why having a travel insurance cover is essential regardless of whether you travel domestically or internationally.
					<br/><br>
					Travel insurance provides coverage against emergencies while traveling, accidental death, loss of baggage, flight cancellation/delay and the likes. Therefore, thereâ€™s no downplaying the role of travel insurance on your travels.
